    in https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet/blob/master/sonnet/python/modules/nets/vqvae.py and
    pytorch implementation of it from zalandoresearch in https://github.com/zalandoresearch/pytorch-vq-vae/blob/master/vq-vae.ipynb.
    Implements the algorithm presented in
    'Neural Discrete Representation Learning' by van den Oord et al.
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937
    Input any tensor to be quantized. Last dimension will be used as space in
    which to quantize. All other dimensions will be flattened and will be seen
    as different examples to quantize.
    The output tensor will have the same shape as the input.
    For example a tensor with shape [16, 32, 32, 64] will be reshaped into
    [16384, 64] and all 16384 vectors (each of 64 dimensions)  will be quantized
    independently.
    Args:
        embedding_dim: integer representing the dimensionality of the tensors in the
            quantized space. Inputs to the modules must be in this format as well.
        num_embeddings: integer, the number of vectors in the quantized space.
            commitment_cost: scalar which controls the weighting of the loss terms
            (see equation 4 in the paper - this variable is Beta).
